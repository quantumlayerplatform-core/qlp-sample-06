Deployment Guide for Your Service

1. Ensure that the environment has Go, Redis, and Kafka installed.
2. Deploy Redis and configure it to run on localhost:6379.
3. Deploy Kafka and configure it to run on localhost:9092.
4. Build the Go service using the command:
   go build -o yourservice
5. Run the compiled binary:
   ./yourservice

Make sure that the ports used by Redis, Kafka, and the service do not conflict with other applications.
