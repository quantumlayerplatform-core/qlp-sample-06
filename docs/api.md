# gen-bef1314b-eae5-4ec5-8c2b-8bc9f1d6db06 API Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the API endpoints provided by the gen-bef1314b-eae5-4ec5-8c2b-8bc9f1d6db06 project, which utilizes gRPC for communication. The project integrates Kafka for messaging and Redis for caching, ensuring efficient data handling and scalability.

- **Response**: `LogoutResponse`
  - `status` (string): Status of the logout process.

### 3. MessageService

#### `PublishMessage`
- **Description**: Publishes a message to a Kafka topic.
- **Request**: `PublishMessageRequest`
  - `topic` (string): The Kafka topic to publish the message to.
  - `message` (string): The message content.
- **Response**: `PublishMessageResponse`
  - `status` (string): Status of the message publishing process.

#### `SubscribeToTopic`
- **Description**: Subscribes to a Kafka topic to receive messages.
- **Request**: `SubscribeToTopicRequest`
  - `topic` (string): The Kafka topic to subscribe to.
- **Response**: `SubscribeToTopicResponse`
  - `messages` (stream of string): Stream of messages from the subscribed topic.
  - `status` (string): Status of the subscription process.

## Error Handling
All services return a standard error message in the response if an operation fails. The error message includes a code and a description to help diagnose issues.

## Security Considerations
- All communication is secured using SSL/TLS.
- Authentication is required for accessing sensitive endpoints.

## Caching Strategy
- User data is cached in Redis to improve performance and reduce latency for frequent read operations.

## Scalability
- The system is designed to scale horizontally to handle increased load by adding more service instances as needed.

## Monitoring and Logging
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring are implemented to track the health and performance of the services.
